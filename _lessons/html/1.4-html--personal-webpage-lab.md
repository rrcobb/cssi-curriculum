# HTML Personal Webpage Lab

# Lab Setup
  + Open your dev folder and create a new folder called my_profile_project
  +	Click Cmd+space
  + Type “Atom” and press enter
  + Go to “file” and click “new file”
  + Click Cmd+S
  + Save your file as “my_profile.html”
  + Save the file in your “html” folder inside your “dev” folder
  + Copy the boiler plate code below and you will have your first html page!

# Boilerplate code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>  
  <head>
    <title>My personal webpage!</title>  
  </head>  
  <body>
    <h1>Heading</h1>
    <p>Some text about you!</p>
  </body>
<html>
```
# Adding sections
For your new personal website all about you! Somethings you can include are: a short bio, your hobbies, facts about your future college etc. Your html webpage should include
+ a title
+ a subheader (using h2-h6 tags)
+	a p tag with a short descriptive paragraph
+	an image (consider using your android Avatar if you can’t find a quick picture that you like)
+	a link  to your g+ page, your github page, or another social media page

# Stretch: Adding pages
Add additional pages to your site by creating three separate html files
+	To link to pages in the same site, use an `<a>` tag.
+	If your site has index.html and aboutme.html and they're in the same directory, a link on the index.html to aboutme.html looks like this
`<a href="my_website/aboutme.html">About Me Page</a>`
+ This is a relative link.
+	Put links in an unordered list using `ul` and `li` tags
