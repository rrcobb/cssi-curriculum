# Why Should You Care?
Python is a scripting language - it is used to perform tasks. Those tasks might be scientific calculations and data analysis, binding together the pieces of a game engine, or, as we'll be using it next week, running a web app. When we run python, we don't run it through the browser, we run it directly on our machines.

# Python Interpreter or Python Script

**Python interpreter**-We start it from the command line and it is most useful when we want to test things out or quickly do a calculation. Just like the javascript console, it evaluates statements and prints the return value back to us immediately.

**Python scripts**- are text files saved with a .py extension, and run from the command line. Scripts are full programs - we can save them, change them, share them, and reuse them. We'll use them to write much more complex code than we could in the interpreter.

# Conclusion
Here are some python resources <a href="http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/getting-started.html">documentation</a> on the Python interpreter
