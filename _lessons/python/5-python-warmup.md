#  Python Day 5 Warm-up!

##  Instructions:
Fork and clone this lab, then complete the drills below.

###  1. Nested for-loops

Create a new python file called `warmup1.py` and complete the following:

1. Write a function called `Yes` that takes an int parameter `excitement_level`. This should print out "Yes!" `excitement_level` times. For example, `Yes(10)` should print out "Yes!" ten times.
2. Write a function called `No` that takes an int parameter `disappointment_level`. This should print out "No" with the number of "o"s equal to `disappointment_level`. For example, `No(10)` should print out "Noooooooooo".
3. Write a function called `ClassStartTime` that takes an integer parameter `start_time` which represents a class's starting hour in 24-hour time. It should have the following behavior:
  * If the class begins after 1 pm, call your `Yes` function with an `excitement_level` equal to the number of hours past noon. So `ClassStartTime(18)` (6pm) should print "Yes" 6 times, and `ClassStartTime(13)` should print "Yes" one time.
  * If the class begins before 1 pm, call your `No` function with a `disappointment_level` equal to the number of hours before 1pm. So `ClassStartTime(12)` should print "No" and `ClassStartTime(7)` should print "Noooooo".
4. Write a function called `ClassSchedule` that takes a dictionary parameter called `schedule`, where the key is the string name of the class, and the value is the start time of the class. For each class in `schedule`, print "(class) is at (start time):00." on one line, then the result of `ClassSchedule` on the next line.
  For example
  ```python
  fall2015_schedule = {
    'Math' : 9,
    'History' : 7,
    'Computer Science' : 15
  }
  ClassSchedule(fall2015_schedule)
  ```
  should print
  
  ```
  Math is at 9:00.
  Noooo
  History is at 7:00.
  Noooooo
  Computer Science is at 15:00.
  Yes!
  Yes!
  Yes!
  ```

###  2. Loops and Lists Drills

1. Given the following list:
  
  `daily_temperatures = [83, 86, 85, 88, 86, 87, 92, 93]`

  Write a loop that prints each item in the list.
2. Write a function called `PrintTemperatures` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and prints each item in the list.
3. Write a function called `AverageTemperature` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the average temperature in the list.
4. Write a functions called `CountHotDays` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the number of temperatures that are above 90.
5. Write a functions called `ModeTemperature` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the most common temperature in the list. If there is more than one mode, return the first mode found.
6. Write a function called `MedianTemperature` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the median element of the list.

###  2. Loops and Dictionaries Drills

Given the following dictionary:
  ```python
  abc_name_to_age = {
    'aaron' : 30,
    'betty' : 14,
    'cindy' : 67,
    'duane' : 18,
    'edgar' : 17,
    'frank' : 65
  }
  ```
1. Write a loop that prints out all the names in the `name_to_age` dictionary.
2. Write a loop that prints out each person's name along with their age in the form of "(name) is (food)", e.g. "aaron is 30"
3. Write a function called `AverageAge` that takes a dictionary parameter called `name_to_age` and returns the average age in the list.
4. Write a function called `CountRetired` that takes a dictionary parameter called `name_to_age` and returns the number of people whose age is above 64.
5. Write a function called `Minors` that takes a dictionary parameter called `name_to_age` and returns a list of the names of the people under 18 years old.

Given the following dictionary:

  ```python
  our_favorite_foods = {
    'victoria' : 'pizza',
    'tim' : 'sushi',
    'cookie monster' : 'cookies',
    'pooh' : 'honey',
    'jiro' : 'sushi',
    'michelangelo' : 'pizza',
    'caesar' : 'pizza',
    'wimpy' : 'hamburger',
    'joseph' : 'frosting'
  }
  ```
1. Write a loop that prints out each person's name along with their favorite food in the form of "(name) loves (food)", e.g. "victoria loves pizza"
2. Write a loop that prints out each person's name along with their favorite food in the form of "(name) Loves (food)", with each word capitalized, e.g. "Victoria Loves Pizza" and "Cookie Monster Loves Cookies".

###  3. Creating Lists and Dictionaries

1. Write a function called `Deltas` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns a list of the differences between each temperature. For example, `Deltas([73, 75, 70])` should return `[2, -5]`. 
2. Write a function called `GetUniqueFavorites` that takes a dictionary parameter called `name_to_favorite_food` and returns a list of all the unique favorite foods.
3. Write a function called `PopularFood` that takes a dictionary parameter called `name_to_favorite_food` and returns the most frequent favorite food in the list. If there is a tie, return the first in alphabetical order. For example, `PopularFood(favorite_foods)` should return "pizza".
