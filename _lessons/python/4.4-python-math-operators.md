# Python Math Operations

# Objectives:

+ Understand how math operators are used in python
+ Understand the order of operations in python

# Motivation
Like we saw when we were exploring the interpreter, Python supports the basic math operators you would expect ``(+, -, *, /)``  Anytime we see an equation in code, python will try to evaluate the expression.


#  Decimals or Floats
There are some caveats about fractions and decimals numbers. Sometimes you'd expect one thing, but python gives you another.
```
>>> 5/2
2
```
It turns out that python is trying to be your friend - when you give it integers, it wants to give you integers right back. When it gets a **decimal or float** it returns a decimal/float.

# Modulo %
% is the remainder operator. When you divide a number, how many are left over?
```
>>> 1 % 3
1
>>> 2 % 3
2
>>> 3 % 3
0
```
