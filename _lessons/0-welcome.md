Welcome to Google's Computer Science Summer Institute! Our team is so excited to work with you, and join you on your journey into computer science.

CSSI aims to provide an introduction to computer science for high school level students with a passion for technology. Our curriculum provides an intensive, interactive and hands-on opportunity for students with minimal exposure to CS to learn the basic concepts of programming. This content seeks to inspire the tech leaders and innovators of tomorrow by supporting the study of computer science, software engineering and other closely related subjects.

We'll be using this site, Learn.co, to deliver curriculum and sample code to you throughout the course. If you can see this page, then your setup is working - no need to worry about any other installation or registration. If you have any thoughts or questions, post them in the G+ group, and we'll try to help you out.

Learning to program is a wild ride, and we are going to learn so much together. We're excited to meet you and get started! Welcome!
