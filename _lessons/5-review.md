#  Day 5: Week 1 Review

##  Instructions:
Today's review will be in the form of "Choose Your Own Adventure": That is, choose whichever topic you'd like to review and complete the lab activities suggested.

###  If you'd like to review...

#  Python

Begin the Day 5 Python warmup on loops, lists, and dictionaries:
* [Day 5 Python warmup](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/cssi-5-python-warmup) **`NEW`**

Finish the labs from the other days:

* [Learn.co Nested lists and dictionaries](https://learn.co/tracks/google-cssi/4-python-intro/python-labs/lab-nested-lists-and-dictionaries)
* [Learn.co Cartoon collections](https://learn.co/tracks/google-cssi/4-python-intro/python-labs/lab-cartoon-collections)

#  JavaScript / jQuery

Finish the labs from the other days:

* [Learn.co Deli Counter](https://learn.co/tracks/google-cssi/2-javascript-intro/labs/lab-deli-counter)
* [Day 3 JavaScript warmup](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/cssi-3-javascript-warmup)
* [Day 4 jQuery warmup](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/cssi-4-jquery-warmup)

If you've completed all the labs and have other specific questions, flag down a TA!

#  HTML/CSS

Check out these slides and resources:
* [HTML, CSS, JavaScript for Google Engineers](https://drive.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0B4LtxgXdHWjSZkpDbDhsckZOMDA/view)
  * These are slides from a 4-hour course Victoria used to teach to Google engineers on how to use HTML, CSS, and JS.
  * Detailed information about layout and positioning here! (floats, etc)
  * Read HTML and CSS, but **skip JavaScript** (requires advanced programming knowledge)
* [University of Washington CSE 154: Web Programming](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/lectures.shtml# today)
  * The first 5 lectures discuss HTML and CSS in detail
  * JavaScript is also discussed later in the course (though using raw JavaScript, no jQuery)

Try out a lab from University of Washington:
* [Journal Lab](http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/15sp/labs/lab2-journal.shtml) **`NEW`**
  * Follow the instructions and ignore the bits that would only be relevant to UW students, i.e. checking in with a TA, uploading to "Webster"
