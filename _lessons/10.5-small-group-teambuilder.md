## GROUP FORMATION & TEAMBUILDER 
### Objective SWBAT:
* Develop a Team Name
* Work Through Natural Team Tendencies

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
* This is a low stress way to observe your group’s communication styles
* Also a fun break in the day before you jump into project planning

### Saving Sam [Site Specific]
Materials:
* Gummy Worm (Sam)
* Gummy “Life Saver” preserver
* 1 Plastic or Paper Cup
* 2-3 Paper Clips (1 per person)
* 1 straw or stirrer (oar) [plastic stirrer is the most challenging]

#### Start
* Sam should be on top of an overturned boat (the face-down cup). 
* The lifejacket (lifesaver) is inside the cup. 
* The oar is on top of the boat (cup) with Sam.

#### Goal:
Sam, the worm’s boat has capsized. You need to save sam by righting his boat, putting his lifejacket on and putting the oar back on the boat. **You cannot touch Sam, the boat, the oar or the life jacket directly with your hands.**

#### End
* Sam needs to have his gummy lifejacket on and be inside the upright boat. 
* The oar is resting across the boat.

#### Debrief:
* What was difficult about working with others?
* Could you have been successful on your own?
* Are there natural strengths in your group that you can replicate? Are there weaknesses that you can mitigate?
