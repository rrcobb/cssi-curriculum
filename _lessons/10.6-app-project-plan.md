## PROJECT PLAN 
### Objective SWBAT:
* Complete your Project Plan

#### Directions
* You will have about an hour to get a head start on your project plan. 
* Make a copy of [this template.](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1bYyLZscWxT5jP8cB9Wu0n3mmgksxmMlka3TJKzVWYyw/edit?usp=sharing)
* Make a COPY, don't start writing your brilliant plans in the master version

***CSSI Folks, we might need to change the link above so that non google.com ppl can access it***

#### Remember
* Technical needs - what technical strengths does your team possess? How can you take advantage of that
* KISS - What is the most basic MVP, the most simple functionality that your app can have.
* Divide and Conquer - how can you split and divide tasks so that everyone has a clear role to play
