###  Putting It All Together
 Think about all the basic programming knowledge we've built upon this week (data types, variables, functions, data structures, etc.) We are laying the foundation for our futures as Python developers. Let's challenge that knowledge with a review project.

###  The Task
In groups of 3 students, you will build a command line calculator.

###  The Instructions
**1** Spend the first 5 minutes as a group with laptops down mapping out the features you want to build and how you want a user to use your calculator.

**2** Keep in mind MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Remember, MVP is the _smallest program you can build that offers value to the user_. That is, make an app that has the minimum amount of features while offering a usable product. In terms of a calculator, maybe your app will only allow users to make calculations with the basic math operations. You might not want to include trig functions like cosine or the square root function in the MVP.

**3** Every design decision has a tradeoff. Focusing on one thing means you won't have time to focus on another.

**4** You have 45 mins to build your calculator.

### Presentations
Presentation should include a demo of your application, a description of the hardest technical challenge you faced, and a comment on the most fun part of building your application.
