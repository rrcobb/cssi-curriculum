## 7.5 FORMS ON GOOGLE APP ENGINE
### STUDENT NOTES
####  HTML Forms (Review)

The form element has two attributes: _method_ and _action_.
* The _method_ attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the forms. 
  * When you use GET, the form data will be visible in the page's url
  * When you use POST, the submitted data is not visible in the page address
* The _action_ attribute tells which script to run or which page to return to once the submit button is pressed. Since the handler takes care of the response, don't worry about the action attribute and leave it blank. 

```
	<form method="post" action ="">
		<p>Question 1: <input type="text" name="answer1"/></p>
		<p>Question 2: <input type="text" name="answer2"/></p>
		<p><input type="submit" value="Grade my Quiz"></p>
	</form>
```


#### Adding the  Post Method
If you use a POST method in your template, you need to add a way for your handler to take care of those post requests.


```python
class MainHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
    	main_template = jinja_environment.get_template('templates/main.html')
    	self.response.out.write(main_template.render())
    def post(self): ## here's the new POST method in the MainHandler
    	self.response.out.write("You have submitted your quiz")
```
In the code above
* When the handler receives a GET request, it's response is to render a template
* When the handler receives a POST request, it's response is to write a message. 

####  Adding a Results Template
Most likely, you'll want to add a new HTML page that gets rendered after the user submits their form. 

Add your results.html file in the templates folder. Then in your MainHandler, be sure to make sure your template gets rendered after a POST request.

```python
class MainHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
    	main_template = jinja_environment.get_template('templates/main.html')
    	self.response.out.write(main_template.render())
    def post(self):
    	results_template = jinja_environment.get_template('templates/complete.html')
    	self.response.out.write(results_template.render())
```

#### LINKING the HTML Form and the Handlers
In order to grab the values from our form, we just need to take advantage of the self.request.get() method and grab our values for answer1 and answer2.


```python
class MainHandler(webapp2.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
    	main_template = jinja_environment.get_template('templates/main.html')
    	self.response.out.write(main_template.render())
    def post(self):
    	results_template = jinja_environment.get_template('templates/complete.html')
    	## the variables that are sent to complete.html are user_answer_1 and user_answer_2
    	## they contain the input values from the main.html form with names answer1 and answer2
    	template_variables = {'user_answer_1': self.request.get('answer1'),
    			  		'user_answer_2': self.request.get('answer2')}
    	self.response.out.write(results_template.render(template_variables))
```    		

#### Using the Template Variables
When your template variables get passed from the handler to the template, you can use them by surrounding them with mustaches `{{ }}`
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Quiz Results</title>
  <head>
  <body>
    <h1> Your answers </h1>
    <p> Your first answer was {{user_answer_1}} </p>
    <p> Your second answer was {{user_answer_2}} </p>
  <body>
</html>
```


### CHALLENGE

* Add a new form in main.html that gets the user’s name and displays it at the top of the results page.
* Add additional quiz questions by making more input elements on  the form. 
* Finish the answer_count by displaying the correct #  of answers on the results.html page. You should have gone over an answer count in class, but if not, the syntax for the loop is below:
  
 ```python
 
answer_count = 0
## a list of the user's answers
user_answers = [self.request.get('answer1'), self.request.get('answer2')] 
##  a list of the correct answers
    	correct_answers = ['correct answer 1', 'correct answer 2'] 
## loop through all of the answers     	
for i in range(len(correct_answers)): 
		## compare if the user answer is the same as the correct answer
	    	if user_answers[i].lower() == correct_answers[i]: 
	    		##  if it is, add 1 to your variable answer_count
	    		answer_count += 1 
```
* If the user gets all of the answers correct, display a fun image about your city.

### STRETCH LAB 
* All of the above. 
* Make a message list, that includes a message to show to the user indicating if they were correct or incorrect. 
	* Start by initalizing a blank list: `msg_list = []` 	
	* As you loop to check each correct answer,  append `'Correct!'` to the msg_list if it's correct
	* Add an else statement to append  `'Sorry Pal'` to msg_list if the answer is incorrect.
* There is a way to iterate through 2 lists at a time - you have to use the zip function. Use it to zip the messages list with the answers list. This will allow you to access the first message in your messages list and the first answer in your answers list at the same time. To display something like 

> Correct! Your answer was: Sears Tower!

  * In your handler use 
```python

quiz_list = zip(msg_list, user_answers) 
  template.render({'combined_list': quiz_list }
  ```
  * In your complete.html template use
```html
{% for  msg, answer in answer_msg_list%}
	<p> {{msg}} Your answer was: {{answer}} </p>
{% endfor %}
```
  to iterate through both lists
